<h1>The Best Movies According to Caro</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Passengers</h3>
<p>Very romantic movie, and also has sci-fi effects.</p>

<h3>Notebook</h3>
<p>Also a romantic one, very recommended.</p>

<h3>Fences</h3>
<p>This movie has a really good story, but what really stands out is the 
    performing of Denzel Wahsington and Viola Davis, I always am amazed 
    by Viola's performings.</p>
